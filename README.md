# NRLBP-based-boundary-detection
A fast novel method for temporal discontinuity detection using NRLBP which used for video captioning

Key features of the proposed approach

1. Illumination invariant
2. Invariant to certain amount of motion effect
3. Rotation invariant
4. Computational efficent

The proposed system include only single stage for boundary detection as described in a paper V2T: video to text framework using a novel automatic shot boundary detection algorithm.

First Stage Bolckwise LBP-HF is used for finding dissimilarity difference between consecutive frames and marking probable abrupt transition
